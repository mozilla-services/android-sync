        <!-- As well as system actions, we also listen for "Health
             Report upload preference changed" notifications sent by
             Fennec: @ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME@.HEALTHREPORT_UPLOAD_PREF.

             We have two receivers.  BroadcastReceiver is a thin
             receiver whose single purpose is to start the background
             service in response to external events. UploadStartReceiver
             handles scheduling background work.
