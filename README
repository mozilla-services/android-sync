* You need Maven 3. `brew update; brew install maven`.

* You need to prepare the repo before you can use it.
  * Use android-sync-app/preprocess.sh to build manifests etc. and to keep
    Eclipse happy. The output is ignored by Git, and the Fennec merge script
    skips them, too.
  * The android-sync-app/fennec-code-drop.sh script does this for you, as well
    as running tests.
  * To run the Android integration tests in Eclipse, you'll need to create
    .project and .classpath in `android-sync-instrumentation`, too.

* To run the unit and integration test suites:
  * `mvn test`
  * `mvn integration-test` with an emulator running or a device connected.

* To make changes to generated files.
  * strings.xml doesn't exist. Modify strings.xml.in.
  * AndroidManifest.xml doesn't exist. Modify the file fragments in manifests/.
  * The same goes for other files that are produced by preprocess.sh.
  * If you want to alter a value _to affect our build only_, put it in
    AndroidManifest.xml.in.

* To merge to mozilla-central:

  cd android-sync-app
  MC=~/moz/hg/mozilla-central
  pushd $MC
  hg qpop --all
  hg pull -u
  hg qnew -m "Android Sync code drop." code-drop
  popd
  ./fennec-code-drop.sh $MC
  pushd $MC
  # hg add any files that have been added. Removing files that have been
  # removed is an exercise for the reader.
  hg qrefresh

* If you *know* all tests pass, or you're in an environment that prevents you
  from running them, you can invoke `android-sync-app/fennec-copy-code.sh`
  directly (with the appropriate environment variables).

* To build mozilla-central:

  # You can do a partial build if you know what you're doing.
  make -f client.mk
  make -C objdir-fennec package
  adb install -r objdir-fennec/dist/fennec*.apk

* You'll need subgit to work with external dependency clones.

* If for some reason you need to work with the external test-android-sync repo:

  git remote add -f android-sync-test ~/path/to/test-android-sync
  git pull -s subtree android-sync-test develop

  (It's a subtree.)
