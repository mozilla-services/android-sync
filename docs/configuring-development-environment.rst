Licensing
---------

Android Services code that is shipped as part of Firefox for Mobile
must be licensed `Mozilla Public License 2.0`_.  Code that is not
shipped (for example, test code, command line scripts, and utilities)
is usually explicitly stated as being in the public domain.

.. _`Mozilla Public License 2.0`: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL

The top-level scripts ``./check_headers.sh`` and
``./check_head_headers.sh`` check, respectively, that all source and
test files, and uncommitted source and test files, correct headers.
(Internally they both use ``./tools/check_headers.py``.)

git hooks
---------

The top-level script ``./pre-commit.sh`` is a git pre-commit hook that
will stop you committing files with incorrect headers.  To install it,
run ::

  archo:android-sync ncalexan$ ln ./pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

.. note:

  If the pre-commit hook is failing, check that
  ``.git/hooks/pre-commit`` exists and is executable.

To temporarily ignore this pre-commit hook, use ``git commit --no-verify``.
