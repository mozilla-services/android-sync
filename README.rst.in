.. ## Old notes -- mostly still correct but not all up to date

.. * You need Maven 3.  Homebrew is possibly easiest:

..   brew update
..   brew install maven

.. * You need to prepare the repo before you can use it.
..   * Use `preprocess.py` to build manifests etc. to keep Eclipse happy. The output
..     is ignored by Git, and the Fennec merge script skips them, too.
..   * The `fennec-code-drop.sh` script does this for you, as well as running tests.
..   * To run Android tests, you'll need to create .project and .classpath in `test`,
..     too.

.. * To make changes to generated files.
..   * strings.xml doesn't exist. Modify strings.xml.in.
..   * AndroidManifest.xml doesn't exist. Modify the file fragments in manifests/.
..   * The same goes for other files that are produced by preprocess.py.
..   * If you want to alter a value _to affect our build only_, put it in
..     AndroidManifest.xml.in.

.. * To run the unit and integration test suites:
..   * `mvn test`
..   * `mvn integration-test` with an emulator running or a device connected.

.. * To merge to mozilla-central:

..   MC=~/moz/hg/mozilla-central
..   pushd $MC
..   hg qpop --all
..   hg pull -u
..   hg qnew -m "Android Sync code drop." code-drop
..   popd
..   ./fennec-code-drop.sh $MC
..   pushd $MC
..   # hg add any files that have been added. Removing files that have been
..   # removed is an exercise for the reader.
..   hg qrefresh

.. * If you *know* all tests pass, or you're in an environment that prevents you
..   from running them, you can invoke `fennec-copy-code.sh` directly (with the
..   appropriate environment variables.)

.. * To build mozilla-central:

..   # You can do a partial build if you know what you're doing.
..   make -f client.mk
..   make -C objdir-fennec package
..   adb install -r objdir-fennec/dist/fennec*.apk

.. * You'll need subgit to work with external dependency clones.
