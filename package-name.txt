#
# While developing Android Sync, you will build android-sync.apk and
# android-sync-test.apk.  These two packages expect a working Fennec
# installation with ContentProvider instances to talk to.
#
# Usually, you should download a recent Fennec Nightly build and use
# `repackage-fennec.sh' to give Android Sync access to Fennec's
# ContentProviders.  Such a package will be called
#
# org.mozilla.fennec
#
# If you are building your own Fennec package, the Fennec package will
# be named:
#
# org.mozilla.fennec_@USERNAME@
#
# (The @USERNAME@ is automatically replaced with your username.)
#
# By default, we want Android Sync to talk to a repackaged Nightly:
org.mozilla.fennec
