[defines]

# Definitions in preprocess.ini override definitions in preprocess.ini.default.

# All definitions used at Android Services preprocess time must be
# present at Fennec build time.  You should never need to do this, but
# see Bug 795499 for an example of adding a preprocessor definition to
# Fennec.

# While developing Android services, you will build android-sync.apk
# and android-sync-test.apk.  These two packages expect a working
# Fennec installation with ContentProvider instances to talk to.
#
# Usually, you should download a recent Fennec Nightly build and use
# `repackage-fennec.sh` to give Android services access to Fennec's
# ContentProviders.  Such a package will be named
#
# org.mozilla.fennec
#
# Usually we want Android Sync to talk to a repackaged Nightly:

ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.fennec
MANGLED_ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.f3nn3c

# If you are building your own Fennec package, the Fennec package will
# be named:
#
# org.mozilla.fennec_%(USERNAME)s
#
# (The %(USERNAME)s is automatically replaced with your username.)  To
# enable this, comment the earlier line and uncomment the following
# line:
#
# ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.fennec_%(USERNAME)s
# MANGLED_ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.f3nn3c_%(USERNAME)s

# Keep MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_ID consistent with
# mobile/android/base/Makefile.in.  If the shared IDs are not the
# same, the Android Sync package's SyncAdapter and instrumentation
# tests will be denied access to the Fennec content provider.

MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_ID = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s.sharedID

# We intentionally change the MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_ACCOUNT_TYPE.  In
# Fennec, these are:
#
# MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_ACCOUNT_TYPE = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s_sync
# MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_FXACCOUNT_TYPE = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s_fxa
#
# Since we want to test without reference to the installed Fennec, we
# define our own testing Android Account types:

MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_ACCOUNT_TYPE = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s_sync_test
MOZ_ANDROID_SHARED_FXACCOUNT_TYPE = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s_fxa_test

# The mozilla-central hg repository and the android-sync git
# repository both build the same set of JUnit 3 instrumentation tests.
# m-c's tests run against the code linked into the Fennec APK; a-s's
# tests run against the code linked into the org.mozilla.gecko APK.
# The following two settings control what the JUnit 3 test package is
# called, and what package it runs against.
#
# In mozilla-central, these are:
#
# ANDROID_BACKGROUND_TEST_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.background.test
# ANDROID_BACKGROUND_TARGET_PACKAGE_NAME = %(ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME)s
# ANDROID_BACKGROUND_APP_DISPLAYNAME = %(MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME)s Background Tests
#
# Since we want to test without reference to the installed Fennec, we
# define our own package names:

ANDROID_BACKGROUND_TEST_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.gecko.test
ANDROID_BACKGROUND_TARGET_PACKAGE_NAME = org.mozilla.gecko
ANDROID_BACKGROUND_APP_DISPLAYNAME = Firefox Sync Background Tests
