/**
 * Record is the abstract base class for all entries that Sync processes:
 * bookmarks, passwords, history, and such.
 *
 * A Record can be initialized from or serialized to a CryptoRecord for
 * submission to an encrypted store.
 *
 * Records should be considered to be conventionally immutable: modifications
 * should be completed before the new record object escapes its constructing
 * scope. Note that this is a critically important part of equality. As Rich
 * Hickey notes:
 *
 *   â€¦ the only things you can really compare for equality are immutable things,
 *   because if you compare two things for equality that are mutable, and ever
 *   say true, and they're ever not the same thing, you are wrong. Or you will
 *   become wrong at some point in the future.
 *
 * Records have a layered definition of equality. Two records can be said to be
 * "equal" if:
 *
 * * They have the same GUID and collection. Two crypto/keys records are in some
 *   way "the same".
 *   This is `equalIdentifiers`.
 *
 * * Their most significant fields are the same. That is to say, they share a
 *   GUID, a collection, deletion, and domain-specific fields. Two copies of
 *   crypto/keys, neither deleted, with the same encrypted data but different
 *   modified times and sortIndex are in a stronger way "the same".
 *   This is `equalPayloads`.
 *
 * * Their most significant fields are the same, and their local fields (e.g.,
 *   the androidID to which we have decided that this record maps) are congruent.
 *   A record with the same androidID, or one whose androidID has not been set,
 *   can be considered "the same".
 *   This concept can be extended by Record subclasses. The key point is that
 *   reconciling should be applied to the contents of these records. For example,
 *   two history records with the same URI and GUID, but different visit arrays,
 *   can be said to be congruent.
 *   This is `congruentWith`.
 *
 * * They are strictly identical. Every field that is persisted, including
 *   lastModified and androidID, is equal.
 *   This is `equals`.
 *
 * Different parts of the codebase have use for different layers of this
 * comparison hierarchy. For instance, lastModified times change every time a
 * record is stored; a store followed by a retrieval will return a Record that
 * shares its most significant fields with the input, but has a later
 * lastModified time and might not yet have values set for others. Reconciling
 * will thus ignore the modification time of a record.
